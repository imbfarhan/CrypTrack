# CrypTrack
## INTRO:
- Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money that is based on blockchain technology
and secured by cryptography.
- There are not many entry level websites which help a beginner to get more info about cryptocurrencies.
- This project aims at tracking the prices of various cryptocurrencies under one
roof. Sometimes it can be difficult to search the prices of various
cryptocurrencies, see their past trends and manage the other related info
separately.
- So, this project aims at easing the process of information management about
cryptocurrency.

## MOTIVATION:
Cryptocurrencies have always left most of us in curiosities, wonders and little
confusions. Through this project we are trying to gain knowledge about cryptocurrency
and to get the information of various spectrum of cryptocurrencies at one place.
